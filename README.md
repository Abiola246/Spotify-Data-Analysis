Spotify Data Analysis Program
This program performs an in-depth analysis of Spotify data to explore various aspects such as popular artists and tracks, the distribution of audio features, genre popularity, and the relationship between audio features and track popularity. The analysis is conducted using Python's powerful data analysis libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Features
Load and Process Data

The program loads the Spotify dataset (spotify-2023.csv) with specified encoding to handle potential character encoding issues.
Identify Popular Artists and Tracks

Groups data by artist and track, counts occurrences, and identifies the most popular artist and track based on the number of tracks and the number of associated artists, respectively.
Visualizes the top 10 popular artists and tracks using bar charts.
Explore Distribution of Audio Features

Visualizes distributions of audio features such as danceability, energy, and valence using histograms or density plots.
Investigates correlations between these audio features and a track's popularity.
Analyze Genre Popularity

Classifies tracks into genres based on audio features or artist information.
Calculates and visualizes the popularity of each genre using bar charts or pie charts.
Explores trends in genre popularity over time.
Investigate Relationship Between Audio Features and Popularity

Uses scatter plots or heatmaps to visualize correlations between audio features (e.g., danceability, energy) and track popularity (e.g., streams or chart position).
Fits regression models to predict track popularity based on its audio features.
Analyze Longevity of Tracks on the Charts

Calculates the number of days each track has been on the charts.
Visualizes the distribution of track longevity using histograms or box plots.
Investigates associations between certain genres or audio features and longer chart runs.
Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Run the program:

bash
python spotify.py
This will load the dataset, perform the analysis, and display visualizations of the results.
